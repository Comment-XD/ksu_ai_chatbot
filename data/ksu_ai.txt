Kennesaw State University Artificial Intelligence Club, also known as KSU AI Club, was founded at August 14th 2022 by current president Nicholi and former vice-president Kalev Martinez.
The club was founded on the principle of introducing AI concepts such as neural networks and deep learning. These concepts will then be implemented into small time projects
such as BusyBee Projects and AskScrappy. Currently, our cabinet consists of president Nico, vice president Branden, media manager Trisha, and treasurer Khang.
